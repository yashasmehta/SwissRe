BIG COMPANY is employing a lot of employees. Company would like to analyze its organizational
structure and identify potential improvements. Board wants to make sure that every manager earns
at least 20% more than the average salary of its direct subordinates, but no more than 50% more
than that average. Company wants to avoid too long reporting lines, therefore we would like to
identify all employees which have more than 4 managers between them and the CEO.
You are given a CSV file which contains information about all the employees. File structure looks like
this:

Each line represents an employee (CEO included). CEO has no manager specified. Number of rows
can be up to 1000.

Write a simple program which will read the file and report:
- which managers earn less than they should, and by how much
- which managers earn more than they should, and by how much
- which employees have a reporting line which is too long, and by how much
Key points:
• use only Java SE (any version), and Junit (any version) for tests.
• use maven for project structure and build
• your application should read data from a file and print out output to console. No GUIs
needed.
• code will be assessed on correctness, simplicity, readability and cleanliness
• If you have any doubts make a sensible assumption and document it
When you're ready with your assignment please send us link to an online code repository (github,
bitbucket, etc.) so we can review your code.
